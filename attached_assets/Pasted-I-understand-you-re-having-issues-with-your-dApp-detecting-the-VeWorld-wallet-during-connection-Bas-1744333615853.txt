I understand you're having issues with your dApp detecting the VeWorld wallet during connection. Based on the knowledge sources, here are some potential solutions:

## Check Your DApp Kit Configuration

When initializing DApp Kit, make sure you have the correct configuration:

```javascript
const vechainWalletKitOptions = {
    // Required - The URL of the node to connect to
    node: 'https://testnet.vechain.org/', 
    // Optional - "main" | "test" | Connex.Thor.Block
    network: 'test', 
    // Optional - Wallet connect options
    walletConnectOptions, 
    // Optional - Defaults to false. If true, the account and source will be persisted in local storage
    usePersistence: true, 
    // Optional - Defaults to the first available wallet. Default value is false
    useFirstDetectedSource: true,
    // Optional - Set a log level to debug the library
    logLevel: 'DEBUG'
};
```

## Ensure VeWorld is in Allowed Wallets

If you're using the `allowedWallets` parameter, make sure 'veworld' is included:

```javascript
allowedWallets={['veworld', 'wallet-connect']}
```

## Check Node Polyfills

DApp Kit requires certain Node.js polyfills to work correctly. If you're using Vite as your bundler, you might need to add these configurations:

```javascript
// vite.config.ts
import { nodePolyfills } from 'vite-plugin-node-polyfills';

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [nodePolyfills()],
    build: {
        commonjsOptions: {
            transformMixedEsModules: true,
        },
    }
})
```

You might also need to add polyfills for Buffer, process, and global variables:

```javascript
// src/polyfills.ts
(window as any).global = window;
global.Buffer = global.Buffer || require('buffer').Buffer;
(window as any).process = {
    env: { DEBUG: undefined },
    version: '', // to avoid undefined.slice error
};
```

## Enable Debug Mode

Set the `logLevel` to 'DEBUG' to get more information about what might be going wrong:

```javascript
logLevel: 'DEBUG'
```

## Check WalletConnect Configuration

If you're using WalletConnect, ensure you have a valid project ID from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-up).
