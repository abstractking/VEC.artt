Based on the analysis of your repository, recent commits, and VeChain wallet functionality code, here is a detailed task list to clean and update your wallet functionality, referencing the latest VeChain documentation:

Task List for Wallet Functionality Updates and Cleanup:
1. Code Cleanup
Refactor Wallet Detection Logic:

Simplify the detectVechainProvider logic to ensure robust detection of VeWorld and VeChainThor wallets.
Remove redundant console logs after debugging wallet detection.
Standardize Error Handling:

Standardize all try-catch blocks for wallet connection errors.
Replace generic error messages with precise, actionable messages.
Optimize Imports:

Remove unused imports across wallet-related files (e.g., SimpleWallet, Framework).
Consolidate utility functions like formatWei into a shared utility file.
Modularize Wallet Types:

Break down wallet-specific logic (e.g., VeWorld, Thor, Sync2) into separate modules for better maintainability.
2. Functional Updates
Update Genesis IDs:

Validate and update genesis IDs in client/src/lib/vechain.ts for testnet and mainnet, referring to VeChain's latest documentation.
Ensure that genesis IDs match the network configuration.
Integrate WalletConnect:

Verify the WalletConnect integration in dapp-kit-config.ts and enhance its configuration for RPC endpoints and project ID validation.
Add detailed error handling for WalletConnect initialization.
Ensure Mobile Compatibility:

Test and update the mobile wallet detection logic in WalletModal.tsx.
Add user-friendly prompts for unsupported wallet types or environments.
Test Environment Support:

Ensure robust handling of test environment keys in development mode.
Validate fallback mechanisms for mock wallets in getConnex.
3. Documentation and Testing
Update Documentation:

Add comments to explain critical wallet-related functions (e.g., connectWallet, getWalletBalance).
Include a README section for developers on how to configure wallet functionality.
Create Test Cases:

Write unit tests for wallet connection functions, focusing on edge cases like unsupported wallets or invalid genesis IDs.
Implement integration tests for WalletConnect using simulated environments.
Verify Against VeChain Documentation:

Cross-check all wallet-related configurations and methods with the latest VeChain wallet documentation.
