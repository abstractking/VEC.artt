for production, but it’s a handy way to sign test transactions in a closed environment. Alternatively, use VeChain’s Sync2 wallet in dialogue mode – Sync2 can be used by dApps to trigger a mobile wallet scan or redirect for signing, which doesn’t rely on browser injection at all. This way, your Replit app could still initiate a testnet transaction and have you confirm it externally. In summary, the code should be written to use Connex for network calls and either the injected wallet (if present) or a fallback signing method when it’s not.

Updated Connection Strategy (vechain.ts)

Below is a revised approach for client/src/lib/vechain.ts that detects the environment and configures Connex accordingly. It uses HTTP connectivity (no direct WebSockets) on Replit, and remains compatible with the VeChainThor wallet outside Replit:

import Connex from "@vechain/connex";

// Determine if running in Replit (e.g., check domain or environment flag)
const isReplit = 
  typeof window !== "undefined" && window.location.hostname.endsWith(".repl.co");

// Choose the appropriate endpoint for VeChain network (testnet here)
const NODE_URL = "https://testnet.veblocks.net";  // HTTP API endpoint for testnet

// Setup Connex options. On Replit, force no wallet extension and rely on HTTP polling.
const connexOpts: Connex.InitOptions = {
  node: NODE_URL,
  network: "test",
  noExtension: isReplit   // in Replit, ignore any wallet extension and use REST API only
};

// (Optional) If needed, you could disable verbose error logs in a Node.js context:
// import { options } from "@vechain/connex-driver";
// options.disableErrorLog = true;

// Initialize Connex
const connex = new Connex(connexOpts);

// Example usage: reading the latest block number
const latestBlock = await connex.thor.block().get();
console.log("Latest Block:", latestBlock.number);

In this setup, Replit will always use the REST endpoint with polling, bypassing any WebSocket requirement. The noExtension: true option ensures Connex doesn’t attempt to interface with a browser wallet (since on Replit there is none, or you purposely want to ignore it). Conversely, when you’re not on Replit, noExtension is false – if a VeChain wallet extension is detected, Connex will allow it to handle user interactions. Your dApp will still fetch blockchain data via the specified node, but signing requests will pop up in VeWorld or Sync as expected.

Using a WebSocket-less approach: Because we’re pointing Connex to an HTTPS URL, all blockchain queries from the connex.thor API use HTTP under the hood . Connex will try to open a WebSocket to track new blocks, but on Replit that connection may fail – at which point Connex falls back to polling the node’s block API periodically . This happens internally. If you want to proactively avoid even attempting the socket, you can explicitly start a polling loop: e.g., call connex.thor.block().get() on an interval to check for new blocks, instead of relying on Connex’s subscription. In practice, letting Connex handle it is fine; just be aware of the fallback behavior.

External proxies: If direct node access is still problematic on Replit (e.g. due to CORS or other network rules), consider using the VeChain Energy proxy endpoint in NODE_URL (for example, https://node-testnet.vechain.energy), which supports WebSocket upgrades and has CORS enabled . This can serve as a drop-in replacement for veblocks.net URLs. Another trick is to route your requests through a small backend service or Cloudflare Worker that you control, which can act as a WebSocket client to VeChain and expose an HTTP interface to your Replit front-end – though this is likely unnecessary given the above solutions.

By implementing the above strategy, your dApp will communicate with the VeChain testnet reliably in Replit’s restricted environment and seamlessly switch to standard behavior (including wallet support) when running elsewhere. The key is using the robust HTTP API for all data fetches and only using WebSockets where they are supported. This ensures stable blockchain connectivity on Replit and full VeChainThor wallet compatibility off-platform.
