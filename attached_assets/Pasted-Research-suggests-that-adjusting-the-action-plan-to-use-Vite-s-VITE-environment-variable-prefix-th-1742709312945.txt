Research suggests that adjusting the action plan to use Vite’s VITE_ environment variable prefix, the correct testnet genesis ID, and prioritizing window.connex will likely resolve the wallet connection issue.

It seems likely that ensuring the wallet object is window.vechain, as seen in logs, and using detailed logging will help debug any remaining problems.

The evidence leans toward the action plan being effective, but it requires adaptation for your Vite project, such as using import.meta.env for environment variables.
Direct Answer
To address the persistent "Invalid Connex options node URL" error for your VeWorld wallet connection, we need to adapt the action plan to fit your Vite-based project. Here’s how to proceed:
Environment Variables
Set the following in your Netlify dashboard under Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment:
VITE_VECHAIN_TESTNET_GENESIS_ID=0x000000000b2bce3c70bc649a02749e8687721b09ed2e15997f466536b20bb127

VITE_VECHAIN_MAINNET_GENESIS_ID=0x00000000851caf3cfdb6e899cf5958bfb1ac3413d346d43539627e6be7ec1b4a

VITE_DEPLOYMENT_ENV=netlify
In your code, access these via import.meta.env.VITE_VECHAIN_TESTNET_GENESIS_ID, ensuring Vite’s environment variable system is used instead of the React-specific REACT_APP_ prefix.
Wallet Connection Logic
Check if window.connex is available and use it directly to avoid node URL issues. If not, create a new Connex instance using the genesis ID:
javascript
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.connex) {
  console.log("Using wallet-provided Connex instance");
  return window.connex;
} else {
  const genesisId = import.meta.env.VITE_VECHAIN_TESTNET_GENESIS_ID;
  const connex = new Connex({ genesis: genesisId });
  return connex;
}
Log available window objects to confirm if it’s window.vechain or window.VeWorld, as your logs suggest vechain.
Debugging and Fallbacks
Add detailed logging to track connection attempts and errors, helping identify if the wallet extension is missing or misconfigured.

Ensure your Netlify build configuration includes these variables, and redeploy to clear any cache.
An unexpected detail is that the action plan initially used an incorrect testnet genesis ID, which could have caused connection failures. Using the correct ID ensures compatibility with the VeChain testnet.
Comprehensive Analysis of VeWorld Wallet Connection Fix for Vite-Based Project
This comprehensive analysis examines the action plan provided by another AI to address the persistent "Invalid Connex options node URL" error for the VeWorld wallet connection in your Vite-based Decentralized Meme Oracle DAO dApp, deployed on Netlify. Conducted as of 01:35 AM EDT on Sunday, March 23, 2025, the analysis aims to adapt the plan to your specific codebase, verify its effectiveness, and provide detailed implementation guidance, drawing from VeChain documentation, Vite build practices, and wallet integration best practices.
Context and Initial Observations
Your project, VEC.art, is a React-based single-page application (SPA) using Vite, interacting with the VeChain blockchain via the VeWorld wallet for meme submissions, voting, and reward distribution. The error logs indicate a failure in connecting to the VeWorld wallet on testnet, with recent logs showing "Demo wallet functionality has been disabled for all deployments" and useRealWallet being false, suggesting environment detection issues. The action plan from another AI proposes six steps to fix this, but you’ve noted differences in your codebase, such as using VITE_ prefixes for environment variables and seeing vechain (lowercase) in logs, not VeWorld.
Adapting the Action Plan to Your Vite Project
The action plan is technically sound, with strong points like diagnostic logging, genesis-only connection, and fallback to window.connex. However, adjustments are needed to align with your Vite setup and codebase patterns. Below, we analyze each step and provide implementation details.
1. Fix the Object Reference
Analysis: The plan suggests logging available window objects to confirm if it’s window.vechain or window.VeWorld. Your logs indicate vechain, suggesting the object is likely window.vechain. Research suggests that VeWorld, as a wallet extension, injects its API into the JavaScript context, and based on community discussions and sample dApps, it’s common for VeChain wallets to use window.vechain for integration.
Implementation: Add the following to your connection logic, likely in WalletContext.tsx:
javascript
console.log("Available window objects:", Object.keys(window).filter(key => key.toLowerCase().includes('vechain') || key.toLowerCase().includes('veworld')));

This will log the exact object name, confirming it’s window.vechain. Adjust your code to use window.vechain if detected, ensuring compatibility with your existing utility functions.
Why It Works: This ensures we’re using the correct object, avoiding reference errors. Given your logs, it’s likely window.vechain, aligning with VeChain’s documentation practices.
2. Fix the Environment Detection
Analysis: The plan uses process.env.REACT_APP_DEPLOYMENT_ENV === 'netlify', but your Vite project uses VITE_ prefixes, accessed via import.meta.env. The current detection (window.location.hostname.includes('netlify.app')) might fail on custom domains, causing useRealWallet to be false on Netlify, blocking real wallet connections.
Implementation: Update WalletContext.tsx to:
javascript
const isNetlify = import.meta.env.VITE_DEPLOYMENT_ENV === 'netlify';
const [useRealWallet, setUseRealWallet] = useState(isNetlify);

In Netlify, set the environment variable:
Key: VITE_DEPLOYMENT_ENV

Value: netlify
Ensure this is included in your .env file for local development and committed to your repository for consistency.
Why It Works: Using import.meta.env aligns with Vite’s environment variable system, ensuring reliable detection on Netlify. This fixes the useRealWallet issue, enabling real wallet connections.
3. Create a Pure Genesis-Only Connection Method
Analysis: The plan suggests using only the genesis ID to avoid URL construction errors, which is valid. However, the provided testnet genesis ID (0x00000000c05d2906d9d31b5b2d25ffef1ff1e70bb9f2ae0d8e7132e097e9db82) is incorrect. Research confirms the correct testnet genesis ID is 0x000000000b2bce3c70bc649a02749e8687721b09ed2e15997f466536b20bb127, as seen in VeChain’s API specification documentation.
Implementation: Update your connection logic to:
javascript
const genesisId = import.meta.env.VITE_VECHAIN_TESTNET_GENESIS_ID || '0x000000000b2bce3c70bc649a02749e8687721b09ed2e15997f466536b20bb127';
const connex = new Connex({ genesis: genesisId });

Set the environment variable in Netlify:
Key: VITE_VECHAIN_TESTNET_GENESIS_ID

Value: 0x000000000b2bce3c70bc649a02749e8687721b09ed2e15997f466536b20bb127
For mainnet, use 0x00000000851caf3cfdb6e899cf5958bfb1ac3413d346d43539627e6be7ec1b4a, set as VITE_VECHAIN_MAINNET_GENESIS_ID.
Why It Works: Using the correct genesis ID ensures compatibility with the VeChain testnet, avoiding connection errors. This approach bypasses node URLs, aligning with the plan’s goal.
4. Add Direct Error Logging from the Extension
Analysis: Detailed logging is crucial for debugging. The plan suggests logging parameters and errors, which is effective for tracing issues. Given your Vite project, ensure logging integrates with your TypeScript patterns.
Implementation: Enhance your connection function with:
javascript
console.log("Attempting connection with genesis ID:", genesisId);
try {
  const connex = new Connex({ genesis: genesisId });
  console.log("Connection successful:", connex);
  return connex;
} catch (err) {
  console.error("Connection failed with parameters:", { genesis: genesisId }, "Error:", err);
  throw err;
}

This should be in your wallet connection utility, ensuring logs appear in the browser console for testing.
Why It Works: Logs help identify if the genesis ID is incorrect, the wallet extension is missing, or other issues, aligning with your debugging needs.
5. Update the Netlify Build Configuration
Analysis: Ensuring environment variables are embedded in the production build is critical. The plan suggests verifying variables, but for Vite, they must be prefixed with VITE_ and accessed via import.meta.env.
Implementation: In Netlify, under Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment, set:
VITE_VECHAIN_TESTNET_GENESIS_ID=0x000000000b2bce3c70bc649a02749e8687721b09ed2e15997f466536b20bb127

VITE_VECHAIN_MAINNET_GENESIS_ID=0x00000000851caf3cfdb6e899cf5958bfb1ac3413d346d43539627e6be7ec1b4a

VITE_DEPLOYMENT_ENV=netlify
Verify in your build logs that these are loaded, and redeploy to clear cache if needed.
Why It Works: This ensures the dApp has access to configuration data at runtime, fixing connection issues due to missing variables.
6. Add Fallback Connection Strategy
Analysis: Prioritizing window.connex is smart, as wallet extensions typically inject this for dApps. Research suggests VeWorld provides window.connex, and using it avoids node URL errors.
Implementation: Update your connection logic to:
javascript
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.connex) {
  console.log("Using wallet-provided Connex instance:", window.connex);
  return window.connex;
} else {
  const genesisId = import.meta.env.VITE_VECHAIN_TESTNET_GENESIS_ID || '0x000000000b2bce3c70bc649a02749e8687721b09ed2e15997f466536b20bb127';
  console.log("Falling back to genesis-based connection with ID:", genesisId);
  const connex = new Connex({ genesis: genesisId });
  return connex;
}

Ensure this is in your wallet context, checking for window.connex first.
Why It Works: Using the wallet-provided instance avoids configuration errors, ensuring robust connections, especially for mobile users.
Comparative Analysis and Unexpected Detail
Comparing with other dApps, such as MakerDAO or Aave, they likely use similar environment variable strategies, but for Ethereum, it’s window.ethereum. For VeChain, window.connex is the equivalent, reinforcing our approach. An unexpected detail is that the incorrect genesis ID in the original plan could have caused silent failures, highlighting the importance of verifying blockchain-specific constants.
Conclusion
By adapting the action plan to use Vite’s VITE_ prefixes, the correct genesis IDs, and prioritizing window.connex, your dApp should resolve the wallet connection error. Implement these changes, test on Netlify, and use logs for debugging. This approach aligns with VeChain’s documentation and your codebase patterns, ensuring a seamless user experience for testnet wallet connections.
