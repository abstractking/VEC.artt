Explore the full documentation and access example use cases by visiting the [VeChain SDK Documentation](https://docs.vechain.org/developer-resources/sdks-and-providers/sdk)

### Commands

[Permalink: Commands](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#commands)

- **Build**: Execute `yarn build` to build the project.
- **Test**: Execute `yarn test:solo` to run all tests.

  - **NOTE**: Integration tests require a local thor-solo node. See the [Integration Testing](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#integration-testing) section for more details.
- **Lint**: Execute `yarn lint` to lint all packages.
- **Format**: Execute `yarn format` to format all packages.

## Integration Testing

[Permalink: Integration Testing](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#integration-testing)

This section provides guidance on conducting integration tests using a local thor-solo node. Ensure Docker is operational on your system before proceeding.

### Setting Up

[Permalink: Setting Up](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#setting-up)

The integration tests interact with a local thor-solo node.
This node uses the `docker/thor/data/instance-a4988aba7aea69f6-v3/main.db` data directory,
which is pre-configured with a block history and 20 seeded accounts for testing.

### Running Tests

[Permalink: Running Tests](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#running-tests)

There are two ways to run tests:

1. **Manual start of thor-Solo node**:
   - To start the thor-Solo node manually, use the command `yarn start-thor-solo`.
   - Once the local thor-Solo node is running, integration tests can be executed with `yarn test`.
   - After testing is complete, stop the node with `yarn stop-thor-solo`.
2. **Simple execution**:
   - For a more straightforward approach, use `yarn test:solo`.
   - This command handles the thor-Solo node's start and stop processes for you.

#### Running tests in a browser-like environment

[Permalink: Running tests in a browser-like environment](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#running-tests-in-a-browser-like-environment)

The SDK fully support execution in a browser environment. To run the tests in a browser-like environment, you can use the `yarn test:browser` command. This command requires a local thor-solo node to be running.
Alternatively, you can run the tests with thor-solo by using the `yarn test:browser:solo` command. This command will start thor-solo, run the tests, and stop thor-solo at the end.

### Custom thor-solo Data Starting Point

[Permalink: Custom thor-solo Data Starting Point](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#custom-thor-solo-data-starting-point)

For advanced testing scenarios, you may require a custom data starting point with thor-solo. This involves creating a custom snapshot of thor's LevelDB.

#### Creating a Custom LevelDB Snapshot

[Permalink: Creating a Custom LevelDB Snapshot](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#creating-a-custom-leveldb-snapshot)

1. **Start thor-solo with Persistence**:
   - Launch thor-solo using Docker with the `--persist` flag. This enables data persistence.
   - Use the `--data-dir` flag to specify the directory where thor-solo will store its data.
2. **Perform Transactions**:
   - Execute the necessary transactions or operations in thor-solo. These transactions will be recorded in the specified data directory.
   - An example of transactions performed to seed the 20 accounts is found in the `thor-solo-seeding.ts` file
3. **Export LevelDB**:
   - Once you've completed the transactions, use a tool like `docker cp` to export the LevelDB directory (i.e., `instance-a4988aba7aea69f6-v3`) from the Docker container.

#### Using the Custom Snapshot

[Permalink: Using the Custom Snapshot](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#using-the-custom-snapshot)

1. **Prepare the Dockerfile**:
   - Modify the Dockerfile used for building the thor-solo container. Ensure it copies the exported LevelDB snapshot into the correct path within the container.
2. **Update Data Directory Path**:
   - Adjust the `--data-dir` flag in your thor-solo startup script or Docker command to point to the new LevelDB snapshot location within the container.
3. **Restart thor-solo**:
   - Rebuild and restart the thor-solo container with the updated Dockerfile. This will launch thor-solo with your custom data starting point.

## Documentation and Examples

[Permalink: Documentation and Examples](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#documentation-and-examples)

On the `/docs` folder you can find the comprehensive **SDK documentation** and executable code examples.
We've designed these examples not just for learning purposes but also as integration tests,
ensuring that the provided code snippets are always functional and up to date.

### Examples

[Permalink: Examples](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#examples)

Our code examples reside in the `./docs/examples` folder. Each example is a stand-alone script that showcases various operations achievable with the SDK. Some of the code examples require a Thor Solo node to be available.

To run the scripts within `./docs/examples` as tests, use:

```
yarn test:examples
```

**NOTE**: Tests require thor-solo to be running locally. You can run and stop separately thor solo node with `yarn start-thor-solo` and `yarn stop-thor-solo` or run all tests with `yarn test:examples:solo` which will start thor solo node, run all tests and stop thor solo at the end.

### Templates

[Permalink: Templates](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#templates)

In the `./docs/templates` folder, you'll find markdown files used to build our final documentation. These templates can include links to example files, dynamically expanded into code snippets during documentation generation.

For instance:

\[example\](examples/accounts/bip39.ts)

The above link, when processed during documentation build, expands into the content of the linked file, ensuring our documentation is as practical as possible.

Note: links that are to be expanded must have a text \[example\]

#### Code Snippets

[Permalink: Code Snippets](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#code-snippets)

It's also possible to include just a code snippet from an example file. For instance:

[DeployContractSnippet](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/contracts/contract-create-ERC20-token.ts)

Will just include into the documentation the code snippet between the comments `// START_SNIPPET: DeployContractSnippet` and `// END_SNIPPET: DeployContractSnippet` in the file `examples/contracts/contract-create-ERC20-token.ts`.

Important: The code snippets names must be unique across all examples and must end with the word "Snippet".

In this way we can keep the examples dry and avoid duplicating code.

### Usage

[Permalink: Usage](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#usage)

To build the documentation, expanding examples into code snippets, use:

```
yarn build
```

### Architecture diagrams

[Permalink: Architecture diagrams](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#architecture-diagrams)

For a comprehensive overview of the package structure, please refer to our [Architecture Diagrams](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/docs/diagrams) located in the documentation directory.

- You can also create and test your examples using `yarn test:examples` command (with solo `yarn test:examples:solo`).

## Experimental Features

[Permalink: Experimental Features](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#experimental-features)

We are continuously working on new features and improvements to enhance the SDK.
You can enable experimental features of specific cryptographic modules by use `useExperimentalCryptography` function of a specific module.

For example:

```
keystore.useExperimentalCryptography(true)
```

## Troubleshooting

[Permalink: Troubleshooting](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#troubleshooting)

### Next.js

[Permalink: Next.js](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/README.md#nextjs)

Projects based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) need the root `tsconfig.json` file includes the options

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2020",
    "types": [\
      "@testing-library/jest-dom"\
    ]
  }
}
```

to define the runtime and the test framework to be compatible with the
[ECMAScript 2020](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/)
language specifications.

An example of **Next.js** [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/apps/sdk-nextjs-integration/tsconfig.json) is available in
the module [sdk-nextjs-integration](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-sdk-js/blob/main/apps/sdk-nextjs-integration).

**Next.js** caches data types when dependencies are installed and the project is built. To be sure
the options defined in `tsconfig.json` are effective when changed,
delete the directories `.next`, `node_modules` and the file `next-env.d.ts`
from the root directory of the project, then rebuild the project.
