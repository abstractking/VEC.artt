he error message suggests that your build is failing due to an issue with Vite externalizing Node.js modules that are required by thor-devkit and @vechain/connex-driver. Here are the most likely causes and potential solutions:

Possible Issues:
Node.js Built-in Modules Are Being Externalized

The error message specifically mentions:
rust
Copy
Edit
Module "crypto" has been externalized for browser compatibility
This means that Vite is treating crypto, http, https, and url as external modules, but thor-devkit and @vechain/connex-driver expect them to be available.
randomBytes Is Not Exported by crypto

The thor-devkit package attempts to import randomBytes from crypto, but Vite externalized it, causing an import failure.
Incorrect Build Target (browser vs. node)

Your dependencies (thor-devkit, @vechain/connex-driver) may rely on Node.js-specific modules, but Vite is treating your project as a browser-only build.
Vite Configuration Missing define or optimizeDeps.exclude

Some VeChain dependencies might need to be included explicitly in the Vite config.
Possible Fixes:
1. Force Vite to Polyfill or Inline Node Modules
Modify your vite.config.js to include the following:

javascript
Copy
Edit
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  define: {
    'process.env': {},
  },
  optimizeDeps: {
    exclude: ['thor-devkit', '@vechain/connex-driver'],
  },
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      external: ['crypto', 'http', 'https', 'url'],
    },
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      crypto: 'crypto-browserify',
      http: 'stream-http',
      https: 'https-browserify',
      url: 'url/',
    },
  },
});
This ensures that crypto, http, and other Node modules are properly resolved for the browser.

2. Install Polyfills for Node Modules
Run the following command to install polyfills:

sh
Copy
Edit
npm install crypto-browserify stream-http https-browserify url
Then import them manually in your vite.config.js:

javascript
Copy
Edit
import crypto from 'crypto-browserify';
import http from 'stream-http';
import https from 'https-browserify';
import url from 'url';
3. Ensure thor-devkit and @vechain/connex-driver Are Compatible
If these packages are outdated or incompatible with browser builds, try updating them:

sh
Copy
Edit
npm update thor-devkit @vechain/connex-driver
Alternatively, you may need to use a different package or find a workaround in your code.

4. Change Build Command in Netlify
Instead of:

sh
Copy
Edit
NODE_ENV=development npm ci && npm run build
Try:

sh
Copy
Edit
NODE_ENV=production npm ci && npm run build
Netlify might be using the wrong environment, causing issues with module resolution.
