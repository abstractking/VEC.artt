ouble-check the recent changes made by the agent, specifically focusing on build error handling and environment variable connections for your Vercel deployment, review the following aspects from your codebase:

Recent Changes Analysis
Vite Configuration Adjustments:

Ensure that the Vite config has been updated to handle Node.js module imports for browser compatibility. You should have something similar in your vite.config.ts (if your file structure places the config there):
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import path from 'path';
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      'http': path.resolve(__dirname, 'path/to/http-shim.js'),
      'https': path.resolve(__dirname, 'path/to/https-shim.js'),
    },
  },
  build: {
    outDir: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  },
});
Patching Scripts:

Review the patching scripts in scripts/prepare-vercel.js to ensure they are correctly addressing compatibility issues with libraries like @vechain/connex-driver. The patches might look something like:
const filePatches = [
  {
    file: path.join(NODE_MODULES_DIR, '@vechain/connex-driver/esm/simple-net.js'),
    replacements: [
      {
        from: `import { Agent as HttpAgent } from 'http';`,
        to: `// Stub implementation for browser compatibility
        const HttpAgent = class { constructor() {} };`
      },
      {
        from: `import { Agent as HttpsAgent } from 'https';`,
        to: `// Stub implementation for browser compatibility
        const HttpsAgent = class { constructor() {} };`
      }
    ]
  },
];
Environment Variables:

Confirm that the necessary environment variables are established in Vercel. The following should be added to your Vercel deployment environment:
VITE_VECHAIN_PRIVATE_KEY=<your_private_key>
VITE_REACT_APP_VECHAIN_NETWORK=test
VITE_VECHAIN_NODE_URL_TESTNET=https://testnet.veblocks.net
Build and Deployment Flow:

After making necessary adjustments, ensure that you execute the build command correctly for Vercel:
npm run build
Error Logs:

Review the logs on Vercel for any warnings or errors related to dependency versions or environment variables. Address any unmet peer dependencies, which was another warning seen in the logs:
Example command to install missing dependencies:
yarn add @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers
By reviewing these aspects in the context of your recent changes, you can ensure that your build and deployment processes are properly configured to avoid errors and ensure compatibility with the Vercel environment.
