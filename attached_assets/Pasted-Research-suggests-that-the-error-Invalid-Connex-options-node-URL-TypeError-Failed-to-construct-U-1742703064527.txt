Research suggests that the error "Invalid Connex options node URL: TypeError: Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL" in your VeWorld wallet connection is likely due to an invalid node URL, possibly from an unset or misconfigured environment variable.

It seems likely that ensuring the node URL is a valid string (e.g., 'https://testnet.veblocks.net' for testnet) and matching the dApp's network with the wallet will fix the issue.

The evidence leans toward using the wallet's provided Connex instance instead of creating a new one, which may avoid the error.
Direct Answer
To fix the "Invalid Connex options node URL: TypeError: Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL" error in your repository, follow these steps to ensure a smooth VeWorld wallet connection for your Decentralized Meme Oracle DAO dApp:
Check the Node URL
The error suggests that the node URL passed to Connex is invalid, likely because it's missing, empty, or improperly formatted. Ensure it's a valid URL, such as 'https://testnet.veblocks.net' for VeChain testnet. Check your code where Connex is initialized (likely in a wallet connection file) and verify the URL is correctly set.
Verify Environment Variables
If the node URL comes from an environment variable (e.g., in a .env file), make sure it's defined. For example, set VECHAIN_NODE_URL=https://testnet.veblocks.net in your environment. This is common in dApps to switch between testnet and mainnet, and an unset variable could cause the error.
Use Wallet's Connex Instance
Instead of creating a new Connex instance, try using the one provided by VeWorld, accessible via window.connex if available. This avoids passing a node URL, as the wallet handles it, potentially resolving the error. Check VeWorld's integration guide for details (VeChain Developer Documentation).
Ensure Network Consistency
Make sure your dApp and VeWorld wallet are on the same network (testnet or mainnet). A mismatch could cause issues, though the error is specifically about URL format. Verify this in your wallet settings.
Add Debug Logging
To pinpoint the issue, add console logs before initializing Connex to print the node URL being used. This helps identify if it's undefined or malformed, guiding further fixes.
An unexpected detail is that VeWorld, as a wallet, should handle the node URL internally, so manually setting it might be unnecessary, potentially causing the error if misconfigured.
Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of VeWorld Wallet Connection Error and Resolution
This survey note provides a detailed examination of the "Invalid Connex options node URL: TypeError: Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL" error encountered in the VeWorld wallet connection for the Decentralized Meme Oracle DAO dApp, hosted at the repository https://github.com/abstractking/VEC.artt/tree/main. The analysis, conducted as of 12:07 AM EDT on Sunday, March 23, 2025, aims to identify the root cause and propose solutions, drawing from VeChain documentation and best practices for wallet integration. It also explores broader implications for dApp development on VeChain, ensuring a robust connection for user engagement and transaction handling.
Error Context and Initial Observations
The error message, logged in the console, indicates a failure during the connection to the VeWorld wallet, specifically when attempting to initialize the Connex instance. The stack trace points to VeWorldAPI.js and a call to newConnex with invalid options, resulting in a TypeError for constructing a URL. The log sequence shows:
"Attempting to connect wallet: veworld"

"Connecting to veworld wallet type on TestNet..."

"Connecting to VeWorld wallet (patched)..."

"VeWorld API methods available: Array(7)"

Error: "VeWorld wallet connection error: ExtensionError: Invalid Connex options node URL: TypeError: Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL"
This suggests that the dApp is detecting VeWorld, attempting to use its API, but failing due to an invalid node URL passed to the Connex initialization. Given the context, the dApp is likely set to testnet, as indicated by the logs, and the error occurs during the connection process, impacting user wallet integration critical for meme submissions and voting.
Root Cause Analysis
Research suggests that the error stems from an invalid node URL, which is a required parameter for Connex initialization. The TypeError indicates that the URL string passed cannot be constructed as a valid URL object, likely due to being undefined, empty, or improperly formatted (e.g., missing protocol like 'https://'). Several potential causes were identified:
Environment Variable Misconfiguration: Many dApps, including this one, use environment variables to set the node URL, allowing switching between testnet and mainnet. If the variable VECHAIN_NODE_URL is not set or is set to an invalid value (e.g., 'testnet.veblocks.net' without protocol), it would trigger the error. For example, in React applications, environment variables are accessed via process.env, and an unset variable defaults to undefined, leading to the failure.

Manual Connex Creation: It seems likely that the code is attempting to create a new Connex instance using VeWorldAPI.newConnex with custom options, including the node URL, instead of using the Connex instance provided by VeWorld. VeWorld, as a wallet extension, typically injects window.connex, which is pre-configured with the correct node URL based on the wallet's network setting. Creating a new instance manually may override this, requiring a valid node URL that, if invalid, causes the error.

Network Mismatch: While the error is specifically about URL format, there's a possibility that the dApp expects a testnet URL, but the configuration or wallet setting is on mainnet, leading to an incorrect URL being passed. However, the error's nature (TypeError for URL construction) leans more toward format issues than network mismatch.

URL Format Issues: The error "Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL" suggests the node URL string is malformed, such as missing the protocol (e.g., 'testnet.veblocks.net' instead of 'https://testnet.veblocks.net') or containing invalid characters. JavaScript's URL constructor requires a properly formatted string, and any deviation would throw this error.
An unexpected detail is that VeWorld, being a wallet, should handle the node URL internally, suggesting that manually specifying it might be unnecessary and prone to errors. This aligns with best practices for wallet integration, where dApps should rely on the wallet's provided Connex instance rather than creating a new one.
Proposed Solutions and Implementation Steps
To resolve the error, the following steps are recommended, ordered by likelihood of success based on the analysis:
Verify and Correct the Node URL:
Locate the code section where Connex is initialized, likely in a wallet connection file (e.g., wallet.js or a context provider). Check for calls to VeWorldAPI.newConnex or similar.

Ensure the node URL passed is a valid URL string. For testnet, use 'https://testnet.veblocks.net', and for mainnet, use 'https://mainnet.veblocks.net'. These URLs are standard for VeChain and can be verified at VeChain Developer Documentation.

If the URL is hardcoded, ensure it includes the protocol. If dynamic, add validation to ensure it's not empty or undefined before passing to Connex.
Check Environment Variables:
Review the .env file or deployment environment for VECHAIN_NODE_URL or similar. Ensure it's set to a valid URL, e.g., VECHAIN_NODE_URL=https://testnet.veblocks.net. In development, use a .env.local file for testing, and in production, ensure it's set in the deployment platform (e.g., Netlify environment variables).

Add a fallback in code: if process.env.VECHAIN_NODE_URL is undefined, log a warning and use a default URL to prevent errors.
Use Wallet's Provided Connex Instance:
Instead of creating a new Connex instance, check for window.connex availability, as VeWorld should inject it. Modify the code to use window.connex directly for blockchain interactions, avoiding the need to specify a node URL. This approach is recommended in the VeChain Developer Documentation for wallet integrations.

If window.connex is not available, fall back to creating a new instance, but ensure the node URL is valid.
Ensure Network Consistency:
Verify that the dApp is configured for testnet (as logs suggest) and that the VeWorld wallet is also set to testnet. In VeWorld, users can switch networks in the extension settings, so instruct users to match the dApp's network. While this may not directly cause the URL error, it ensures compatibility.
Add Debug Logging for Troubleshooting:
Before calling newConnex, add a console.log to output the options being passed, especially the node URL. For example, console.log('Connex options:', options);. This helps identify if the URL is undefined or malformed, guiding further debugging.

Check the browser console for these logs to see the exact value causing the error.
These steps should address the error, ensuring a seamless wallet connection for users interacting with your DAO, crucial for meme submissions, voting, and reward distribution.
Broader Implications for DAO Development
This error highlights the importance of robust wallet integration in dApps, particularly for DAOs like the Decentralized Meme Oracle DAO, where user engagement relies on seamless blockchain interactions. The reliance on environment variables for network configuration underscores the need for clear documentation and testing, especially during deployment. The preference for using wallet-provided Connex instances aligns with decentralization principles, reducing the dApp's dependency on specific nodes and enhancing scalability.
Additionally, the error's occurrence on testnet suggests early testing is effective in catching configuration issues before mainnet deployment, a best practice for security and user experience. Future enhancements could include automated network detection, ensuring the dApp dynamically adjusts to the wallet's network, further reducing such errors.
Comparative Analysis with Other DAOs
While specific to VeWorld, similar issues are noted in other blockchain ecosystems, such as MetaMask for Ethereum, where incorrect RPC URLs can cause connection failures. DAOs like MakerDAO and Aave, with robust wallet integrations, likely implement similar checks, ensuring environment variables are validated and wallet-provided providers are prioritized. This comparison reinforces the proposed solutions, aligning with industry standards for dApp development.
Conclusion
The "Invalid Connex options node URL" error is likely due to an invalid or unset node URL, resolvable by verifying the URL, checking environment variables, and using the wallet's Connex instance. These steps ensure a robust connection, enhancing user outreach and engagement for your DAO, with broader implications for dApp reliability and scalability.
