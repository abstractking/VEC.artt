Prompt:

Add a “Royalty Slider” and a “Collab Slider” to the NFT creation page.

Royalty Slider
Let the user set a percentage (e.g., 0–10%) that will be applied as royalties on secondary sales.
Store or display the chosen royalty percentage so it can eventually be passed to the smart contract.
Collab Slider with Wallet Input
Provide a slider or input that allows the user to set how much of the sale proceeds go to a collaborator’s wallet.
Include a text field where the user can enter the collaborator’s wallet address.
For now, just store this data in the component’s state; assume it will eventually be passed to the smart contract to handle splits.
Adjust the color scheme to ensure sufficient contrast:

No light text on light backgrounds or dark text on dark backgrounds.
Maintain the overall dark theme but increase contrast where needed (e.g., lighten text or darken backgrounds).
Keep the brand’s existing color palette, but ensure headings, buttons, and text fields are clearly legible against their backgrounds.
Create detailed mock drafts for all pages linked in the footer. Write realistic placeholder text and copywriting that explains:

Where each page is located in the navigation or site flow.
What the page covers (e.g., “Help Center,” “Platform Status,” “Partners,” “Blog,” “Newsletter,” etc.).
Relevant links or sections on each page (e.g., FAQ links in Help Center, partner application forms, etc.).
Any special features or calls to action.
Finally, update the UI so that these footer pages (and the main site) follow the improved color scheme. Keep it consistent with the rest of the marketplace design.

Notes:

Make sure the royalty and collab sliders are integrated into the Create NFT flow (e.g., Step 2: “Pricing” or Step 3: “Review”).
Provide clear variable names and comments in the code for future integration with the smart contract logic.
For the footer page mockups, supply thorough placeholder text that can later be replaced with production copy. Include headings, subheadings, and example paragraphs or bullet points.
Ensure that the color scheme changes are applied site-wide, respecting the brand’s current colors but improving legibility.
