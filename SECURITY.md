# VeCollab Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security practices and considerations for the VeCollab marketplace.

## Private Key Management

### Development Environment

- **Private keys in `.env` files**: Development keys should only be used for local testing and never contain actual funds.
- **Key generation**: Use the provided script (`node temp-key-gen/generateKey.js`) to generate random keys for testing.
- **Mock wallets**: In development mode, the application can use mock wallets to avoid exposing real keys.

### Production Environment

- **Netlify Environment Variables**: Store all production private keys as encrypted environment variables in the Netlify dashboard.
- **No client-side exposure**: Never expose private keys in client-side code or browser storage.
- **Key rotation**: Regularly rotate production keys, especially after personnel changes or suspected breaches.

## Blockchain Security

### Smart Contract Interaction

- **Testnet first**: Always deploy and test on VeChain TestNet before moving to MainNet.
- **Transaction verification**: All transactions should be verified before signing.
- **Gas estimation**: Proper gas estimation should be implemented to prevent transaction failures.

### Wallet Connection

- **Connection options**:
  - Browser wallet extensions (VeChain Sync2) - preferred for production
  - Private key from environment variables - only as fallback
  - Test wallets - only in development environments

- **Security hierarchies**:
  1. Browser wallet extensions (most secure)
  2. Server-side signing with environment variables (fallback)
  3. Mock wallets (development only)

## Application Security

### Data Protection

- **User data**: Personal information should be minimized and secured.
- **Database security**: Proper authentication and authorization for database access.
- **Input validation**: All user inputs must be validated and sanitized.

### Network Security

- **HTTPS**: All production connections must use HTTPS.
- **WebSocket security**: WebSocket connections must validate origin and user sessions.
- **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy headers are configured in `netlify.toml`.

## Incident Response

### Security Breaches

1. **Immediate actions**:
   - Suspend affected services
   - Rotate compromised keys
   - Document the incident

2. **Analysis**:
   - Determine breach scope and impact
   - Review affected systems
   - Identify vulnerability source

3. **Recovery**:
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Deploy security patches
   - Implement additional safeguards

## Security Checklist for Deployment

- [ ] No private keys in Git repository
- [ ] Environment variables properly set in Netlify
- [ ] CSP headers configured correctly
- [ ] WebSocket connections secured
- [ ] User authentication implemented securely
- [ ] Smart contract interactions verified
- [ ] Transaction signing mechanisms tested
- [ ] TestNet functionality confirmed before MainNet deployment

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by contacting the development team directly. Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed.
