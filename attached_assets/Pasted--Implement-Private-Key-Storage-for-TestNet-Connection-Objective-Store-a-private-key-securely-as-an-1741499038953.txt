 Implement Private Key Storage for TestNet Connection
Objective: Store a private key securely as an environment variable and use it to connect to the VeChain TestNet.

Files to Modify:

.env: Store the private key securely.
client/src/lib/vechain.ts: Modify to utilize the environment variable for connecting to the TestNet.
Steps:

Environment Setup: Add an entry in your .env file to store your private key.
Example:
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
Code Implementation:
In client/src/lib/vechain.ts, modify the function to extract the private key from the environment variable and use it to connect to the TestNet.
import { SimpleWallet } from '@vechain/connex-driver';
export const connectWalletWithEnvKey = async () => {
  const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
  if (!privateKey) {
    throw new Error("Private key not set in environment variables");
  }
  try {
    const wallet = new SimpleWallet();
    wallet.import(privateKey);
    // Initialize Connex or other logic to connect using the wallet
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to connect using private key from env:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
// Example usage:
(async () => {
  try {
    await connectWalletWithEnvKey();
    console.log('Connected to TestNet using environment key');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Connection failed:', err);
  }
})();
Configuration:

Environment Variables in Replit:
Go to your Replit project.
Open the Secrets tool (or Environment Variables if available).
Add a new entry for PRIVATE_KEY with your actual private key value.
Ensure your .env file is included in Replit's environment configuration.
Testing and Validation:

Ensure the application can connect to the TestNet without errors.
Verify that the private key is not logged or exposed anywhere in your code or output.
By storing the private key in the environment variables, you gain security and flexibility, allowing for different configurations between development and production environments.
