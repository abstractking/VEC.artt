# VeChain Wallet Connection Fixes for Vercel Deployment

This document outlines the changes made to fix MIME type issues and wallet connection problems when deploying to Vercel.

## Summary of Changes

1. **Fixed MIME Type Issues with Polyfills**
   - Changed the Vercel polyfills loading from external script to an inline script
   - This prevents MIME type errors that can occur with Vercel's static file hosting

2. **Enhanced Environment Detection**
   - Updated environment-service.ts to detect Vercel environments more accurately
   - Added support for checking VITE_DEPLOYMENT_ENV variable

3. **Improved Genesis ID Handling**
   - Now retrieving Genesis IDs directly from environment variables
   - Enhanced error handling when Genesis IDs are missing

4. **Added Special Handling for Vercel**
   - Implemented Vercel-specific wallet fallback mechanisms
   - Added development wallet for Vercel to ensure functionality

5. **Fixed Issues in Polyfill Implementation**
   - Corrected typos in the polyfill initialization
   - Enhanced Buffer and crypto polyfills for better compatibility
   - Improved environment variable handling

## Technical Details

### MIME Type Fix

The original method of loading vercel-polyfills.js would sometimes cause MIME type errors:

```javascript
// Old approach - external script
<script type="module" src="/src/vercel-polyfills.js"></script>
```

The new approach injects the polyfill code directly into the HTML as an inline script:

```javascript
// New approach - inline script
<script type="text/javascript">
   // Polyfill code goes here directly
</script>
```

This works because:
- Vercel's build process now includes the polyfill code directly in the HTML
- No chance of MIME type errors since the script content is embedded
- Polyfills are guaranteed to load before any other scripts

### Environment Variable Handling

We've enhanced the environment variable handling in the polyfills:

1. Added hardcoded fallbacks for critical variables
2. Improved merging of existing and fallback values
3. Added logging to help debug environment variable issues

### Vercel Detection Logic

Enhanced environment detection specifically for Vercel deployments:

```typescript
// Is this a Vercel environment?
isVercel: typeof window !== 'undefined' && (
  window.location.hostname.includes('vercel.app') ||
  window.location.hostname.includes('.now.sh') ||
  import.meta.env.VITE_DEPLOYMENT_ENV === 'vercel'
)
```

### Development Wallet for Vercel

Added special handling for Vercel environments:

```typescript
// Special handling for Vercel
if (isVercel) {
  logger.info(`Vercel environment detected, using development wallet mode for ${getDeploymentType()}`);
  return createDevelopmentWallet();
}
```

This ensures users always have a working wallet experience on Vercel deployments.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Make sure all environment variables are correctly set in Vercel project settings
2. Use the unified deployment process as detailed in VERCEL-DEPLOYMENT.md
3. Verify wallet functionality after deployment by checking the console logs

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing a more robust service worker-based polyfill approach
2. Add more granular feature detection for wallet capabilities
3. Explore ways to maintain real wallet connections in Vercel environment
