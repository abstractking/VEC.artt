Next Steps to Debug
Here are some additional debugging steps to pinpoint the issue:

1. Check if useLocation is Returning Undefined
Try adding this log in NFTDetail.tsx (or wherever useLocation is used):

tsx
Copy
Edit
import { useLocation } from "wouter";

const location = useLocation();
console.log("Location:", location);
If location is undefined, then the problem is in how wouter is set up.

2. Ensure That Navigation Uses the Correct State Structure
If you're navigating to NFTDetail.tsx with state (e.g., navigate("/nft", { state: { from: "/home" } })), verify that the state object is actually being passed.

Check if location.state is undefined:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const location = useLocation();
console.log("Location state:", location?.state);
If state is undefined, make sure you're passing it correctly when navigating.

3. Check for Incorrect Imports
Ensure useLocation is correctly imported from wouter:

tsx
Copy
Edit
import { useLocation } from "wouter";
If it's imported from react-router-dom, that could cause issues.

4. Debug VeChain Wallet Integration
Make sure connectWallet returns a structure that matches what WalletContext.tsx expects:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const connectWallet = async () => {
  const result = await vechain.connectWallet();
  console.log("Wallet Connect Result:", result);
  
  if (!result || !result.vendor) {
    console.error("Unexpected wallet structure:", result);
  }

  return result;
};
Then, check in WalletContext.tsx that setWalletAddress(result.vendor.address); is not called when result.vendor is undefined.

5. Fix Buffer Polyfill Issue
Since you installed buffer, make sure it's being polyfilled properly in vite.config.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import { NodeGlobalsPolyfillPlugin } from '@esbuild-plugins/node-globals-polyfill';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  optimizeDeps: {
    esbuildOptions: {
      define: {
        global: 'globalThis'
      },
      plugins: [
        NodeGlobalsPolyfillPlugin({
          buffer: true
        })
      ]
    }
  }
});
Then import it in polyfills.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { Buffer } from "buffer";
window.Buffer = Buffer;
And in main.tsx:

tsx
Copy
Edit
import "./lib/polyfills";
Summary
Add debug logs to useLocation to confirm state is being passed.
Ensure navigation includes { state: { from: "/home" } } if from is expected.
Verify connectWallet returns the expected structure.
Properly polyfill Buffer for Vite.
Try these and let me know what logs you get!
