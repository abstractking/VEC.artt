The error message you're encountering, SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list, usually indicates a misplaced parenthesis in your JavaScript code. This can happen in one of the scripts being executed: scripts/prepare-vercel.js, vite.config.vercel.js, or scripts/post-build-vercel.js.

Here's a suggested troubleshooting plan:

Check scripts/prepare-vercel.js: Look through the code for any syntax errors, especially around function calls, the use of template literals, or similar constructs that require correct parentheses.

Inspect vite.config.vercel.js: Also review configuration in this file, as issues could arise from environment variable definitions or plugin configurations where parentheses must balance.

Review scripts/post-build-vercel.js: Ensure there are no syntax errors in this script, particularly where you might be setting routes or handling the serverless function handler.

To further assist, the most probable cause is in the global configuration or a misplaced parenthesis in any of these script files.

Next Steps:
Open and carefully inspect the three scripts.
Use a linter for JavaScript (like ESLint) to find syntax errors more easily.
Identify the exact line mentioned in the stack trace if possible, and ensure all parentheses are correctly matched.
