To address the build error you're encountering on Vercel, you need to consider the connection issues related to the imports for Node.js modules that have been externalized for browser compatibility. Here's a structured prompt for the agent AI to help fix the build errors, including the necessary .env configurations:

Build Error Resolution Prompt:
Issue Description:

The build fails due to the following error:
error: "Agent" is not exported by "__vite-browser-external", imported by "node_modules/@vechain/connex-driver/esm/simple-net.js".
This indicates that certain Node.js modules (http, https, vm) cannot be resolved in the browser context.
Proposed Solution:

Update the Vite configuration to alias these Node.js modules to appropriate browser-compatible alternatives.
Add a browser field to the Vite configuration if necessary, especially to support @vechain/connex-driver.
Environment Variables Check:

Ensure all required environment variables are set up in Vercel:
VITE_VECHAIN_PRIVATE_KEY=<your_private_key>
VITE_REACT_APP_VECHAIN_NETWORK=test
VITE_VECHAIN_NODE_URL_TESTNET=https://testnet.veblocks.net
Check Dependencies:

Install any unmet peer dependencies as indicated in the warnings:
For example:
yarn add @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition-ethers @nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers @nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify @typechain/ethers-v6 @typechain/hardhat @types/chai @types/mocha chai ethers
Modify Vite Configuration:
Include a resolve option in your vite.config.ts to handle these external Node modules:

import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      'http': 'rollup-plugin-node-builtins/http.js',
      'https': 'rollup-plugin-node-builtins/https.js',
      'vm': 'rollup-plugin-node-builtins/vm.js',
    },
  },
  // Other configurations...
});
Rebuild and Deploy:

After making these changes, run the build command:
yarn run build
Redeploy the application on Vercel to see if the issues are resolved.
By following these steps and ensuring that the project dependencies and environment configurations are correct, you should be able to address the build errors successfully.
